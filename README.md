## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) - CSS framework
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) - For type safety in react.



### What I learned

Through this challenge, I learnt how to use Typescript and Tailwind CSS with React, and I understood more about useState and how pass props between components. I also learnt about the Tailwind CSS class names, and I'm actually getting used to them(some sound funny though)ðŸ« . This is my first project with any of these technologies, and It's exciting to see what I have created with them.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```


### Continued development

 Iâ€™m done with the primary design of the webpage, but I plan on adding more features, such as profile settings, or leveraging the fake store API to add more products or use more of the API's features ðŸ›’.


### Useful resources
