## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) - CSS framework
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) - For type safety in react.



### What I learned

Through this challenge, I learnt how to use Typescript and Tailwind CSS with React, and I understood more about useState and how pass props between components. I also learnt about the Tailwind CSS class names, and I'm actually getting used to them(some sound funny though)ðŸ« . This is my first project with any of these technologies, and It's exciting to see what I have created with them.



### Continued development

 Iâ€™m done with the primary design of the webpage, but I plan on adding more features, such as profile settings, or leveraging the fake store API to add more products or use more of the API's features ðŸ›’.


### Useful resources

- [Chat GPT](https://chat.openai.com/) - OpenAI's chatbot helped me with a few issues, especially with the bugs I was facing when trying to deploy to netlify.
- [Codeium AI](https://codeium.com/) - This helped notably in the initial stages of the project, when I was still trying to set it up by adding React through vite, and adding Tailwind CSS and Typescript. It also offers explanation of errors and proffers solutions to them(though the solutions will not be correct all the time). It offers code completion as well, saving me the hassle of having to type out the code everytime.
